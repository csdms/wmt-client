WMT
===

The CSDMS Web Modeling Tool
---------------------------

WMT is a RESTful web application that succeeds the desktop CSDMS
Modeling Tool, [CMT](http://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/CMT_information).
WMT allows users to build and run coupled surface dynamics models on a
high-performance computing cluster (HPCC) from a web browser on a
desktop, laptop or tablet computer.

With WMT, a user can:
* select a Common Component Architecture (CCA) component model from a
  list to run in standalone mode,
* build a coupled model from multiple components organized as nodes of
  a tree structure,
* view and edit the parameters for these model components,
* upload custom input files to the server,
* save models to a server, where they can be accessed on any
  Internet-accessible computer,
* share saved models with others in the community, and
* run a model by connecting to a remote HPCC where the components are installed.

Although WMT is web-based, the creation and configuration of a model
can be done offline.  Reconnection is necessary only when saving a
model and submitting it for a run.

For a detailed description of the WMT interface, please see
[WMT Help](http://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/WMT_help) on the CSDMS
website.  For a brief tutorial, please see the
