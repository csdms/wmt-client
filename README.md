# WMT-client

**WMT-client** is a client-side user interface
for the CSDMS Web Modeling Tool, [WMT](https://github.com/csdms/wmt).

**WMT-client** is written with [GWT](http://www.gwtproject.org/),
a toolkit that allows Ajax applications to be developed in Java.
For deployment on the web,
the GWT compiler translates the Java code
to optimized and obfuscated JavaScript.
GWT emphasizes cross-browser compatibility,
and is supported on all modern browsers.
Unit tests are performed with [JUnit](http://junit.org/).
Continuous integration testing is performed with [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/).

For a detailed description of the **WMT-client** interface,
please see [WMT Help](http://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/WMT_help)
on the CSDMS website.
For a brief tutorial,
see the [WMT Tutorial](http://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/WMT_tutorial).
An instance of WMT running **WMT-client**
can be found at https://csdms.colorado.edu/wmt.

See the [Releases](https://github.com/csdms/wmt-client/releases) page
for downloads.

## About WMT

The CSDMS Web Modeling Tool (WMT) is
a web application that provides an Ajax client-side graphical
interface (**WMT-client**)
and a RESTful server-side database and API
(**WMT-server**) that allows users,
from a web browser on a desktop, laptop or tablet computer,
to build and run coupled Earth
system models on a supercomputer.

For more information on WMT and **WMT-server**,
see https://github.com/csdms/wmt.


## About CSDMS

[CSDMS](http://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/Main_Page),
the Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System,
is an NSF-funded project that supports a diverse community
of users and developers
of earth and ocean system models. 
CSDMS develops, integrates, archives and disseminates
earth system models and tools to an international community
with the goal of building the frameworks necessary
to model the earth system.
Modelers use CSDMS for access
to hundreds of open source surface dynamics models and tools,
as well as model metadata.
